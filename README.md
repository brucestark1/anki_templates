# anki_templates
Contains templates for Anki cards, and code to auto-generate Anki cards (coming soon)

# How to use the card templates

In the directory `card_templates`, you'll find a series of sub-directories, each one corresponding to a particular card type. Within each of these directories, there are four files:

* **bront_template**, containing the HTML for the front of the card
* **back_template**, containing the HTML for the back of the card
* **styling**, containing the CSS for the "styling" section of the card
* **readme**, for an explanation of how this particular card type works (e.g. which fields you have to add, and how to create new cards)
* Any other relevant files
